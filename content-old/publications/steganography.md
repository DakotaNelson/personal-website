This series of blog posts introduces the reader to steganography, <em>the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video</em>. It then builds on that foundation to introduce error correcting codes - specifically, Hamming codes - and some of the math behind it all.

The sample code which formed the nucleus for this series was part of a class project for my discrete math class in college, and can be found [on Github](https://github.com/DakotaNelson/hamming-stego).

All of this content can also be found on [the Striker Security Blog](https://strikersecurity.com/blog/image-steganography-example-guide/).
