As of June 2019, I'm the #8 contributor to Empire by commits. I've added several fairly major features, most notably the Empire plugin system, a complete overhaul of the system Empire uses to handle events and pass messages, and a new templating process using jinja that makes agents much easier to write.

I also helped close a few issues, answer questions on GitHub, and generally be a positive member of the community.

There's a blog post I wrote about Empire's plugin system [here](https://strikersecurity.com/blog/empire-plugins/).
