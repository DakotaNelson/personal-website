# Hey, welcome.

This is the webiste of Dakota Nelson.

My day job is at Black Hills Information Security as a penetration tester. Outside of that... well, where do I even start?

This site is mostly an exercise for myself; a sort of self-documentation, to help me keep track of things of interest. I believe the act of writing something down forces you to clarify it in your mind, and this site will ideally do so for the things I think about most often.

It's extremely a work in progress, and likely always will be.

Please, feel free to poke around, or to reach out and say hi at dakota (big 'ol dot) w (another dot, crazy) nelson at (the google mail place, you know the one). If you want to reach me some other way, [Keybase](https://keybase.io/dakota) has nearly every way to reach me. I'm currently not on any social media platforms, so email is probably going to be your best bet.
