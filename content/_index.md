# Hey, welcome.

This is the webiste of Dakota Nelson.

This site is mostly an exercise for myself; a sort of self-documentation, to help me keep track of things of interest.

It's extremely a work in progress, and likely always will be.

Please, feel free to poke around, or to reach out and say hi at dakota (dot) w (another dot, crazy) nelson at (the google mail place, you know the one). If that doesn't work, [Keybase](https://keybase.io/dakota) has nearly every way to reach me. I'm currently not on any social media platforms, so email is probably going to be your best bet.
