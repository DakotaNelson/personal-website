This talk at BSides Las Vegas 2015 covers Sneaky-creeper, a python library that allows for command and control over third-party sites such as Twitter, Tumblr, SalesForce, Google Sheets, and SoundCloud. The library is designed for ease of use, and has an API much like that of a standard "internet socket"-type library (except, of course, that the bits are flowing over third-party services).
