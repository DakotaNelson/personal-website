# Interests

I have... way too many, and pursue them with varying degrees of time investment and zeal. Here are a few.


## Information Security

## Wilderness Medicine

## Robots

## Space

SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE

## Forecasting/Foresight/Future Studies

## Finance & Monetary Policy

## National Security/Arms Control/Intelligence/OSINT

## Strategy/History

## Synthetic Biology

## Risk Management

## Disaster Preparedness, Recovery, and Response

## Learning/Human Cognitive Performance

This was kicked off by "Learning how to Learn" on Coursera and I've since read PILES of books about it. Things like spaced repetition (in the form of Anki) have shown strong enough results for me that I'm now hooked and want more understanding of how to make my brain better at doing what I want it to.

## Chinese Language

I'm studying. I'm very bad at it.
