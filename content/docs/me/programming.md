# Programming

You can find me [on GitHub](http://github.com/dakotanelson/), which is likely to be the best way to see exactly what I'm working on at any given time.

A fair bit of the code I work on isn't public, but ipso facto that means I can't talk about it anyway.

Generally, my projects have one or more of these characteristics:

- offensive security (i.e. malware)
- data aggregation/analysis
- OSINT


# Favorite and/or Noteworthy Projects

## Sneaky-creeper

tl;dr command and control for malware over social media. A pioneer of the technique as far as I'm aware (excepting several APT groups, mostly Russian, most noticeably HAMMERTOSS).

## Pushipin-web

tl;dr it constantly collects geotagged social media from areas you define, then lets you view the collected data on a map or search through it. Useful for answering questions such as "are people posting pictures of their badge while they're at my facility" and "what does the inside of that building look like?"
