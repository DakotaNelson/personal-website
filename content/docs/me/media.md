## Security of the Near Field Communication Protocol

I published this as a senior in high school, so go easy on me.

Click/touch/tap/glare menacingly at the expandy box below if you want to see the abstract.

With the booming of smartphone and wireless networks, contactless payment systems have been gradually accepted by a range of sectors and industries. Near Field Communication (NFC), as a de facto standard for radio communication, dominates this market and has accumulated many applications, such as use as a digital wallet and ticketing system, due to its convenience and versatility. The prevalent use and large cash flow of NFC have attracted the attention of attackers and criminals. In this paper, we present an overview of the security issues surrounding the NFC protocol and its applications. We investigate the existing and potential vulnerabilities of NFC, discuss effective countermeasures for mitigating these vulnerabilities, and further present design considerations for new NFC applications.

A series of blog posts introducing steganography and Hamming error-correction codes. Fun to write, and I like to think it's fun to read (and informative). Plus it has somewhere in the neighborhood of a million pictures of a super floofy puppy so honestly what more do you want from me.
