# Books!

I love them dearly.

## But First...

Before we start, I would like to take this time to encourage you to try out Libby: https://meet.libbyapp.com/.

It's a fantastic app you can use to check out library eBooks. Seriously life-changing.

Ok, now into the books. This isn't a complete list, for an assortment of reasons, the primary one being that I don't always keep track of everything I read, especially ones I consider to be more like textbooks (e.g. anything I "study" instead of "read" probably isn't listed here). Also there are books I don't finish that don't make the list.

## The Rating Scale

If it's bolded, it was particularly good.

I have taken notes on some books. If you see a `+` after the book, you can click it to see my notes.

# 2019

### Lone Survivor, Luttrell

### Modern Romance, Ansari

### Kingpin, Poulsen

### Autonomous, Newitz

### Halting State, Stross

### Dragnet Nation, Angwin

### The Worst is Yet to Come, Fleming

### **Pattern Recognition, Gibson**

### The Borrowed World, Horton

This book was both free and awful.

### Gun Machine, Ellis

### **Spook Country, Gibson**

### Company Town, Ashby

### **Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, Perkins**

This was *fascinating*. Big, if true.

### **Zero History, Gibson**

### The Difference Engine, Gibson and Sterling

### **Distrust that Particular Flavor, Gibson**

### Class 11, Waters

### **Random Acts of Senseless Violence, Womack**

This was heartwrenching. Probably the dystopian book that has felt the most "real" to me in the sense that the story played out as I suspect would be most likely - not as a heroic fantasy of guns and glory survival but as a bunch of regular people slouching into a slowly worsening future they feel powerless in the face of.

### The City and the Stars, Clarke

### **Superforecasting, Tetlock and Gardner**

### **Alas, Babylon, Frank**

### The Caryatids, Sterling

### The Three-Body Problem, Liu

### **Atomic Habits, Clear** [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An5B62CFypRK9IIQKT812R7yy3QRF4ux3ks/)

### American War, El Akkad

### A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit

I didn't finish this book because I felt like I got what I wanted out of it; the author's main premise is that preople are actually pretty wonderful to one another in the aftermath of catastrophe. The popular concept of post-disaster reality as full of looting and crime, she argues, is inaccurate - there's crime, as always, but (apparently) the crime rate tends to go *down* after a disaster as everyone pulls together into a newly strengthened civic fabric. Fascinating and important but could have been much shorter.

### Quicksilver, Stephenson

### The Sheep Look Up, Brunner

### **Ultralearning, Young** [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An5FfDoK7lhM9Kl0NAYaM5TEyRZ9tjaa95w/)

### The Shockwave Rider, Brunner

### Deep Work, Newport [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An7f563LsRlObav5eyfTs0MGWNwzMIAtStI/)

### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Manson

### Slow Horses, Herron

### Red Mars, Robinson

### The 4 Hour Body, Ferriss

Felt like a collection of semi-random notes, internally contradictory and without any coherence. Meh.

### Fall, Stephenson

### I Will Teach You to be Rich, Sethi

### Medallion Status, Hodgman

# 2020

### All our Wrong Todays, Mastai

### Five Days at Memorial, Fink

### How to Read a Book, Adler [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An5U2_k5bmdYKLKHwuGzQqLln_awKSyiYPE/)

### **The Black Swan, Taleb** [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An7o2GyCN7dPhaTaQon9Mxp18u3J32gDksM/)

### Blank Spots on the Map, Paglen

### The Way of the Knife, Mazzetti

### Tropic of Kansas, Brown

### Vagabonding, Potts

### Crooked Little Vein, Ellis

### Getting Things Done, Allen

### The Art of Learning, Waitzkin

### The Dictator's Handbook, Mesquita

### The Final Day, Forstchen

This series started well and ended just AWFULLY, wow.

### The Making of a Manager, Zhuo

### Agency, Gibson

### The Operators, Rennie

This was fascinating.

### The Ghost of the Executed Engineer, Graham

### The Outlaw Ocean, Urbina

### The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Gaiman

This is my second and last Gaiman book. For some reason they hit a chord just wrong, and both have been just cripplingly depressing. I don't have any interest in doing that to myself.

### Satin Island, McCarthy

### The Plague, Camus

Timely. Too timely.

### **METAtropolis, Scalzi**

### Overclocked, Doctorow

### Hardwired, Williams

### Thinking in Systems, Meadows

### How to Do Nothing, Odell

### **The Moon is Down, Steinbeck**

I will probably re-read this occasionally when I'm feeling hopeless. What a great book.

### Grit, Duckworth [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An7fZIAaH2BFkqNmj5XzccCiWdloQKn6aRU/)

### Red Plenty, Spufford

### **Old Man's War, Scalzi**

### **Matterhorn, Mariantes**

### The Crying of Lot 49, Pynchon

### The People's Republic of Walmart, Philips

Really fascinating premise but could have been maybe a quarter the length.

### **In Praise of Idleness, Russell**

### Singularity Sky, Stross

### Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook, Luttwak

### How to Measure Anything, Hubbard

### **Out of the Mountains, Kulcullen** [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An6VFEXKDktH4pDArPHpoV4wumTRfvFTNCM/)

### The Warehouse, Hart

Pretty hamfisted but a quick and fairly interesting read.

### Capitalist Realism, Fisher [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An7oeA6x0zpHlLj4CFpYtWBw7zdoaNlpRbQ/)

Ugh. I wish there were more books that were about this type of topic without the absolutely impenetrable "high-brow academic only read by other academics" writing style.

### Sandworm, Greenberg

### The War on Everyone, Evans

### Factfulness, Rosling [+](https://www.evernote.com/l/An6HHun98Y5AQbczbGsgSYdAgSoXU3aTE2c/)

### Some Remarks, Stephenson
