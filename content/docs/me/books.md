# Books!

Before we start, I would like to take this time to encourage you to try out Libby: https://meet.libbyapp.com/.

It's a fantastic app you can use to check out library eBooks. Seriously life-changing.

Ok, now into the books. This isn't a complete list, for an assortment of reasons, the primary one being that I don't always keep track of everything I read, especially ones I consider to be more like textbooks.
