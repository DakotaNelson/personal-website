# Books!

I love them dearly.

## But First...

Before we start, I would like to take this time to encourage you to try out Libby: https://meet.libbyapp.com/.

It's a fantastic app you can use to check out library eBooks. Seriously life-changing.

Ok, now into the books. This isn't a complete list, for an assortment of reasons, the primary one being that I don't always keep track of everything I read, especially ones I consider to be more like textbooks (e.g. anything I "study" instead of "read" probably isn't listed here). Also there are books I don't finish that don't make the list.

## The Rating Scale

If it's bolded, it was particularly good.

# 2019

### Lone Survivor, Luttrell

### Modern Romance, Ansari

### Kingpin, Poulsen

### Autonomous, Newitz

### Halting State, Stross

### Dragnet Nation, Angwin

### The Worst is Yet to Come, Fleming

### **Pattern Recognition, Gibson**

### The Borrowed World, Horton

This book was both free and awful.

### Gun Machine, Ellis

### **Spook Country, Gibson**

### Company Town, Ashby

### **Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, Perkins**

This was *fascinating*. Big, if true.

### **Zero History, Gibson**

### The Difference Engine, Gibson and Sterling

### **Distrust that Particular Flavor, Gibson**

### Class 11, Waters

### **Random Acts of Senseless Violence, Womack**

This was heartwrenching. Probably the dystopian book that has felt the most "real" to me in the sense that the story played out as I suspect would be most likely - not as a heroic fantasy of guns and glory survival but as a bunch of regular people slouching into a slowly worsening future they feel powerless in the face of.

### The City and the Stars, Clarke

### **Superforecasting, Tetlock and Gardner**

### **Alas, Babylon, Frank**

### The Caryatids, Sterling

### The Three-Body Problem, Liu

### **Atomic Habits, Clear**

### American War, El Akkad

### A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit

I didn't finish this book because I felt like I got what I wanted out of it; the author's main premise is that preople are actually pretty wonderful to one another in the aftermath of catastrophe. The popular concept of post-disaster reality as full of looting and crime, she argues, is inaccurate - there's crime, as always, but (apparently) the crime rate tends to go *down* after a disaster as everyone pulls together into a newly strengthened civic fabric. Fascinating and important but could have been much shorter.

### Quicksilver, Stephenson

### The Sheep Look Up, Brunner

### **Ultralearning, Young**

### The Shockwave Rider, Brunner

### Deep Work, Newport

### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Manson

### Slow Horses, Herron

### Red Mars, Robinson

### The 4 Hour Body, Ferriss

Felt like a collection of semi-random notes, internally contradictory and without any coherence. Meh.

### Fall, Stephenson

### I Will Teach You to be Rich, Sethi

### Medallion Status, Hodgman

# 2020

### All our Wrong Todays, Mastai
