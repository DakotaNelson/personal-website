I do outreach for OEM, including teaching classes to the community about disaster preparedness and response and tabling at events.

## Radio Operator, _Seattle Auxiliary Communications Service_

_Late 2018 - Present_

Seattle Auxiliary Communications Service provides communication support to the City of Seattle in times of disaster and emergency. I'm a radio operator, meaning I use my ham radio license to move information when more conventional means like the phone network are unavailable. I generally work in the Seattle Emergency Operations Center, so I've seen ICS operating firsthand.
