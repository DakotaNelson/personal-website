# Coursera

I spend a lot of time studying things I find interesting; it's an odd hobby but there you have it. Coursera plays a fairly large part in that.

My profile is here: https://www.coursera.org/user/c0937fc573eefc8c9d2272de12406533

I did the original two Udacity courses waaaay back when, but my account appears not to work any longer (I assume they moved fast and broke things) and I haven't bothered to email them.

For some reason, I never got much into edX. I did part of MIT's 6.002x back when it first rolled out, and dabbled in a few other courses, but none stuck.

As of now, here's what I've done on Coursera within the past few years:

- Chinese Politics 1 and 2
- The entire EMT specialization
- Learning How to Learn
- Risk in Modern Society
- Bayesian Statistics
