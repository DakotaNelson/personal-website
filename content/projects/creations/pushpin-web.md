Social media permeates modern society. Whether it's customers, competitors, or criminals, they're broadcasting to the world - and to you, if you listen.

Pushpin-web provides a simple and intuitive interface to keep an eye on social media around your real-world assets. While other platforms focus on marketing or branding with keyword-focused search, pushpin-web keeps its eyes on the physical world by collecting and displaying geotagged media near critical locations you designate.
